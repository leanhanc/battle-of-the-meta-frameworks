# Nuxt development log

## Previous experience

I have some experience with Nuxt v2 from working on a professional website. After reviewing the documentation and videos on v3, it appears that the framework has taken a significant leap forward. Back then, not having access to Vue 3 was a bit of a disappointment, but I am excited to try it out now.

## Getting started and Hero Section

Starting the project and exploring the docs to get a sense of new Nuxt features and its current state was quick and painless. <br />
Setting up Tailwind was straightforward with the _@nuxtjs/tailwindcss_ module. <br />
So far, everything looks good.
