# Qwik development log

## Previous experience

None. I have high expectations for Qwik. All I've heard up to this point is very exciting, so I am eager to try it myself. <br />
I've never used [signals](https://www.builder.io/blog/usesignal-is-the-future-of-web-frameworks) before, so that's something I'm particularly looking forward to.

## Getting started and Hero Section

Another great CLI tooling! It seems like this is becoming the norm. Qwik uses JSX, so building the component was easy for me since I have a lot of experience with React. <br />
At this point, there aren't many Qwik-specific features I had to learn, but in general, everything felt familiar. The entry points, starting files, and routing all look similar to those in Remix. All good so far!
