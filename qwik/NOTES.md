# Qwik development log

## Previous experience

None. I have high expectations for Qwik. All I've heard up to this point is very exciting, so I am eager to try it myself. <br />
If you haven't heard anything in particular about Qwik I recommend an episode of [Learn with Jason](https://youtu.be/_PDpoJUacuc) by Jason Lengstorf featuring Mi≈°ko Hevery, creator of both Angular
and Qwik. You will find a lot of great insight on Qwik and meta-frameworks in general.<br />
I've never used [signals](https://www.builder.io/blog/usesignal-is-the-future-of-web-frameworks). This is the approach to state Solid took and Qwik adopted. That's something I'm particularly looking forward to.

## Getting started and Hero Section

Another great CLI tooling! It seems like this is becoming the norm. Qwik uses JSX, so building the component was easy for me since I have a lot of experience with React. <br />
At this point, there aren't many Qwik-specific features I had to learn, but in general, everything felt familiar. The entry points, starting files, and routing all look similar to those in Remix. All good so far!
