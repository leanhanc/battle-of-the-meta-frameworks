# Solid JS development log

## Previous experience

I have zero experience with Solid. However, I heard Ryan Carniato, the creator of Solid, discussing signals and Solid in general with Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski on the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm/show/577/supper-club-solid-js-with-ryan-carniato), which caught my attention. I recommend listening to that episode to gain a better understanding of what Solid has to offer.

## Getting started and Hero Section

Solid's documentation contains more technical vocabulary than the norm, which forces you to delve deeper and understand the underlying concepts. <br />
Unfortunately, I couldn't find a search feature on their documentation, so I had to browse to find specific features and built-in components, such as ErrorBoundary. <br />
Solid Start's documentation is good but still a work in progress. The meta-framework is currently in beta stage as I am bootstrapping this project. <br />

Solid follows the same approach as many other meta-frameworks, providing a convenient CLI interface for developers to choose a good starting configuration. Setting up Typescript and Tailwind was quick and easy because of this.
