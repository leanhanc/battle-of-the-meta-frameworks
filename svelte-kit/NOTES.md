# Svelte-Kit development log

## Previous experience

My previous experience with SvelteKit was creating a To-Do app before version 1.0 was released. The app had authentication to persist tasks, but I did not delve deep into it. <br />

## Getting started and Hero Section

Everything was a breeze. Setting up Tailwind was easy with an adapter, and the project structure was familiar to me as it's similar to the one used in Next JS app directory. <br />
Svelte's syntax is easy to pick up and it seems like a good alternative as a framework overall with its "compile away" method which reduces the amount of JS shipped to the client and performant reactivity system. Additionally, I find the single-file components used in Vue and Svelte very convenient, especially when you keep your components small.
